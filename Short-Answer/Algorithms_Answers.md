#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(1) - where 1 is a, we're simple math functions which take as fast as looking up  

   n = 1
   a = 0
    while (0 < 1 * 1 * 1)
    a = 0 + 1 * 1


b)O(n^2) 
    The functions time is directly proportional to the for & while loop. 

c)O(n) - where n is bunnies
    bunnyears is called n-1 each time, which would also be O(n)
